# Inventory Reporting Features Implementation

This document outlines the new inventory reporting features implemented for the vending machine app.

## Overview

Three comprehensive inventory reporting features have been added to help users understand current stock levels, track restock activities, and predict future stock needs:

1. **Current Stock Report** - Real-time view of all product stock levels
2. **Restock Summary** - Historical analysis of restock activities over time
3. **Stock Coverage Estimate** - Predictive analysis of stock longevity based on consumption patterns

## Features Implemented

### 1. Current Stock Report

**Purpose**: Display current stock levels for each product across all machines and warehouse inventory.

**Key Information**:
- Product-level summary with warehouse and machine stock totals
- Machine-level detail showing stock for each product in each machine
- Visual indicators for stock levels (low, normal, high)
- Location and machine information
- Product pricing and slot information

**API Endpoint**: `GET /api/inventory/current-stock/`

**Query Parameters**:
- `product` - Filter by specific product ID
- `location` - Filter by specific location ID  
- `machine` - Filter by specific machine ID

### 2. Restock Summary

**Purpose**: Show restock activities within a selected date range to understand restocking patterns.

**Key Information**:
- Date range analysis with configurable time periods
- Product-level summaries showing total units restocked and discarded
- Detailed restock history with timestamps and user information
- Machine and location breakdown
- Summary statistics (total products restocked, total units, etc.)

**API Endpoint**: `GET /api/inventory/restock-summary/`

**Query Parameters**:
- `start_date` / `end_date` - Custom date range (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `days` - Preset time periods (7, 14, 30, 90 days)
- `product` - Filter by specific product ID
- `location` - Filter by specific location ID

### 3. Stock Coverage Estimate

**Purpose**: Calculate and display estimated stock coverage based on historical consumption patterns.

**Key Information**:
- Weekly consumption rate calculations based on historical restock data
- Estimated weeks of stock remaining for each product/machine combination
- Status indicators (Critical, Low, Moderate, Good)
- Restock recommendations
- Product-level aggregations and machine-level details
- Analysis period configuration

**API Endpoint**: `GET /api/inventory/stock-coverage/`

**Query Parameters**:
- `analysis_days` - Number of days to analyze for consumption patterns (default: 30)
- `product` - Filter by specific product ID
- `location` - Filter by specific location ID

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Django)

**New API Views** in `backend/core/views/analytics_views.py`:
- `CurrentStockReportView` - Handles current stock reporting
- `RestockSummaryView` - Handles restock activity analysis  
- `StockCoverageEstimateView` - Handles consumption-based stock predictions

**URL Routes** in `backend/core/urls.py`:
- `/api/inventory/current-stock/`
- `/api/inventory/restock-summary/`
- `/api/inventory/stock-coverage/`

**Data Sources**:
- `Product` model - Warehouse inventory quantities
- `MachineItemPrice` model - Current machine stock levels
- `RestockEntry` model - Historical restock data for consumption calculations
- `ProductCost` model - Historical cost information

### Frontend (Vue 3)

**New Components**:
- `frontend/src/views/Inventory.vue` - Main inventory reports page with tabs
- `frontend/src/components/inventory/InventoryFilterControls.vue` - Unified filter controls
- `frontend/src/components/inventory/CurrentStockReport.vue` - Current stock display
- `frontend/src/components/inventory/RestockSummary.vue` - Restock history display  
- `frontend/src/components/inventory/StockCoverageEstimate.vue` - Coverage predictions display

**New Composable**:
- `frontend/src/composables/useInventoryReports.js` - Centralized state management and API calls

**Navigation**:
- Added "Inventory" link to main navigation menu
- Added "Full Report" quick link in dashboard's low stock items section

### Key Features

**Filtering & Time Periods**:
- Location and product filtering across all reports
- Flexible time period selection (7 days, 2 weeks, month, 3 months, custom range)
- Analysis period configuration for consumption calculations

**Visual Indicators**:
- Color-coded stock level indicators (red=critical, orange=low, green=good)
- Status badges for coverage estimates
- Summary cards with key metrics
- Responsive tables with hover effects

**Data Presentation**:
- Summary cards showing key metrics at the top
- Detailed tables with sortable data
- Product type badges (Soda/Snack)
- Location tags and machine information
- Timestamp information for data freshness

## Usage Instructions

### Accessing Inventory Reports

1. **From Main Navigation**: Click "Inventory" in the top navigation menu
2. **From Dashboard**: Click "Full Report" button in the Low Stock Items section

### Using the Reports

1. **Filter Data**: Use the filter controls at the top to narrow down by location, product, or time period
2. **Switch Between Reports**: Use the tab navigation to switch between Current Stock, Restock Summary, and Stock Coverage
3. **Analyze Data**: Each report provides both summary metrics and detailed breakdowns
4. **Export Consideration**: Reports show generation timestamps for data freshness tracking

### Understanding Stock Coverage

The Stock Coverage Estimate uses historical restock data to calculate:
- **Weekly Consumption**: Average units consumed per week based on restock patterns
- **Weeks Remaining**: Current stock divided by weekly consumption rate
- **Status Categories**:
  - **Critical**: Less than 1 week remaining
  - **Low**: 1-2 weeks remaining  
  - **Moderate**: 2-4 weeks remaining
  - **Good**: 4+ weeks remaining
- **Restock Recommendations**: Automatic flagging when stock is projected to run low

## Benefits

1. **Inventory Visibility**: Clear view of current stock across all locations and machines
2. **Restock Planning**: Historical data helps optimize restock schedules and quantities
3. **Predictive Insights**: Consumption-based predictions help prevent stockouts
4. **Operational Efficiency**: Centralized reporting reduces manual inventory tracking
5. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Comprehensive metrics support better inventory management decisions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Export functionality (CSV, PDF)
- Email alerts for low stock conditions
- Integration with supplier ordering systems
- Advanced forecasting with seasonal trends
- Mobile-optimized views for field operations
- Barcode scanning integration for stock updates
