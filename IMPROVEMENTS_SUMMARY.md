# Vending Machine Management System - Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the vending machine management system to address the requested features and bugs. The main goals were to:

1. **Fix Purchase Unit Cost Calculation**: Ensure proper calculation and storage of unit costs when recording purchases
2. **Implement Demand Tracking**: Add functionality to calculate and track product demand per machine based on restock data
3. **Improve Data Persistence**: Ensure all restock data is properly saved for demand estimation
4. **Code Quality Improvements**: Clean up code, add proper error handling, and improve maintainability

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Demand Tracking System

#### New Model: `DemandTracking`
- **File**: `backend/core/models/demand_tracking.py`
- **Purpose**: Tracks demand per product per machine based on restock data
- **Key Fields**:
  - `machine` and `product` (ForeignKeys)
  - `previous_visit` and `current_visit` (visit tracking)
  - `previous_stock_after_restock` and `current_stock_before_restock` (stock levels)
  - `days_between_visits`, `total_consumption`, `daily_demand` (calculated values)

#### Key Methods:
- `calculate_demand()`: Calculates demand between consecutive visits
- `get_average_demand()`: Gets average daily demand over specified period

#### How It Works:
When a user goes to the Restock view and records a visit:
1. System records `stock_before`, `discarded`, and `restocked` quantities
2. Upon saving, it automatically calculates demand by comparing with previous visit
3. Formula: `consumption = previous_stock_after_restock - current_stock_before`
4. Daily demand = `consumption / days_between_visits`

**Example**: 
- Previous visit: Machine had 10 cans after restock
- Current visit (2 days later): Machine has 6 cans before restock
- Consumption: 10 - 6 = 4 cans
- Daily demand: 4 cans ÷ 2 days = 2 cans per day

### 2. Enhanced Purchase Unit Cost Calculation

#### Improvements Made:
- **File**: `backend/core/models/wholesale_purchase.py`
- **Enhancement**: Improved precision in unit cost calculation using proper Decimal arithmetic
- **Code Change**: 
  ```python
  # Before: return self.total_cost / self.quantity
  # After: 
  result = self.total_cost / Decimal(str(self.quantity))
  return result.quantize(Decimal('0.01'))
  ```
- **Benefit**: Ensures unit costs are properly rounded to 2 decimal places

#### Purchase Process Flow:
1. User enters quantity and total cost in Purchases view
2. System automatically calculates unit cost = total_cost / quantity
3. Creates ProductCost record for cost history tracking
4. Updates product inventory automatically
5. All cost calculations are properly rounded and stored

### 3. Enhanced Product Model

#### New Methods Added:
- **File**: `backend/core/models/product.py`
- `get_demand_for_machine(machine, days=30)`: Get demand for specific machine
- `get_total_demand_across_machines(days=30)`: Get total demand across all machines
- `get_recommended_stock_level(machine, days_ahead=7)`: Calculate recommended stock levels

#### Business Logic:
- Recommended stock = (daily_demand × days_ahead × 1.2) for 20% safety buffer
- Considers machine capacity constraints
- Uses 30-day rolling average for demand calculations

### 4. API Enhancements

#### New Endpoints:
- **File**: `backend/core/views/demand_tracking_views.py`
- `GET /demand-tracking/`: List all demand records with filtering
- `GET /demand-tracking/summary/`: Aggregated demand data by machine/product
- `GET /demand-tracking/by_machine/`: Demand data grouped by machine
- `GET /demand-tracking/by_product/`: Demand data grouped by product

#### Enhanced Product API:
- **File**: `backend/core/serializers/product_serializer.py`
- Added `total_daily_demand` field showing demand across all machines
- Added `demand_records_count` field showing number of demand calculations

### 5. Frontend Demand Analysis Dashboard

#### New Component: `DemandAnalysis.vue`
- **File**: `frontend/src/views/DemandAnalysis.vue`
- **Features**:
  - Filter by machine, product, and time period
  - Summary cards showing total products tracked, machines, and average demand
  - Detailed table with demand levels color-coded by urgency
  - Modal for viewing detailed demand history per product/machine
  - Real-time data fetching and error handling

#### UI Features:
- **Color-coded demand levels**:
  - Red: ≥5 units/day (High demand)
  - Yellow: 2-4.99 units/day (Medium demand)  
  - Green: 1-1.99 units/day (Low demand)
  - Gray: <1 unit/day (Very low demand)

### 6. Automatic Demand Calculation

#### Integration Points:
- **File**: `backend/core/models/restock_entry.py`
- **Enhancement**: Added `_calculate_demand()` method called automatically on save
- **Process**: Every time a restock entry is created, demand is calculated and stored
- **Error Handling**: Demand calculation failures don't break the restock process

### 7. Database Schema Updates

#### Migration Created:
- **File**: `backend/core/migrations/0004_demandtracking_and_more.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Created DemandTracking table
  - Added indexes for optimal query performance
  - Established foreign key relationships
  - Added unique constraints to prevent duplicate calculations

### 8. Code Quality Improvements

#### Error Handling:
- Added try-catch blocks around demand calculations
- Proper validation for negative stock scenarios
- Graceful degradation when demand data is unavailable

#### Performance Optimizations:
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Efficient aggregate queries for summary data
- Lazy loading of demand details in frontend

#### Documentation:
- Comprehensive docstrings for all new methods
- Clear variable names and function purposes
- Code comments explaining business logic
